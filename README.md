## E--Commerce-Retail-Analysis
# Description of the project
This project is on an e-commerce retailer in the United Kingdom's dataset. We were able to analyze the data using python and draw insights from the dataset. We also created a data report using google documents where we reported our findings and made slides using google slides for the final presentation. 

# Installation instructions
Setup git clone https://github.com/Nasreenz/E--Commerce-Retail-Analysis.git and extract the zip file then open the colab Notebook and the data report file.

we did our data mining on google colab and our data report on google docs. I downloaded the two files and put them in a folder which i later pushed to github.
